# fiRetruck
An esoteric version of the R language.
fiRetruck uses 9 characters: \!^+()[], and 3 functions: substr, paste0 and parse.

Here's the agenda, and feel free to contribute yourself to any:
  - [ ] Develop an API *or* an R package for easy conversions
  - [ ] Add versions of fiRetruck in other languages (I'm thinking R or C++ first)
  - [ ] Check succinctness - is there a way to make fiRetruck outputs shorter by using 
    - [ ] ...the current character set?
    - [ ] ...alternate approaches?
  - [ ] Develop a method to evaluate output

There are almost definitely bugs, so please point them out to me.
